# firefox-topline-release-dashboard

## install

run `npm install`, like you'd expect

## further development requires an understanding of

1. React, which I used for the main layout to speed up development
2. D3 / Metrics-Graphics, which we're using for now to show lines

## build

run `npm run build` to have webpack build the output. Will watch this directory for changes and rebuild.
